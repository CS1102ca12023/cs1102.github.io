- **Reduced File Size:** Significantly lowers file sizes, enhancing storage and transmission efficiency for multimedia, with a quality-file size trade-off (Salomon, Motta, & Bryant, 2009).

- **Variable Compression Ratios:** Allows choosing between compression strength and quality, affecting file size and fidelity (Sayood, 2017).

- **Irreversible Compression:** Compression is permanent; original data cannot be fully restored post-decompression (Wallace, 1991).

- **Psycho-Visual Techniques:** Exploits human visual perception limitations to prioritize compression of less noticeable information (Skodras, Christopoulos, & Ebrahimi, 2001).

- **Temporal and Spatial Compression:** Reduces redundancy in video through techniques targeting changes over time and within frames (Wiegand, Sullivan, Bjontegaard, & Luthra, 2003).
